# Graphs
This data structure is a collection of vertices(nodes) that may be connected by directional or bi-directional edges.

## Challenge
Create a graph from scratch without using the Graph from System.Collections.

## Approach & Efficiency

## API
- AddNode: Create a new vertex with a specified value  and add it to adjacency list, key is node value and value are the edges.

- AddEdge: adds an edge to a node. Takes in a source node, destination vertex and weight of the edge.

- GetNodes: Retrieves all nodes from the graph.

- GetNeighbors: Retrieves every neighboring  node(Vertex) of a particular node.

- GetSize: Gets the size of the graph within integer format.

- Print: Shows the graph.
